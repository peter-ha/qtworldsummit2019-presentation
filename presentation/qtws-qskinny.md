# [fit] QSkinny - A new approach
# [fit] for a QtQuick framework

---

# Who am I?

- working on Qt since 2008
- former QtNetwork maintainer
- [@peha23](https://twitter.com/peha23) on Twitter
- founder of [edelhirsch.io](https://www.edelhirsch.io)

---

Why?

---

- Widgets: no OpenGL etc.
- Qt 5.4 not fast enough
- performance issues with QtQuickControls 1
- QtQuickControls 2 are not extensible (font, palette, locale / some of its logic is in QML)

=> try how far you can get with own framework

---

What?

---

... is QSkinny?

A lightweight framework on top of the Qt scene graph

---

(here show diagram)

---

QSkinny is...

- usable from C++
- usable from QML

=> QSkinny and QML are not mutually exclusive

---

How?

---

(here show scene graph composition demo (page indicator?))

---

QSkinny does not only offer a C++ API, it also offers:

- a more complete layouting system similar to the one of QtWidgets (QSizePolicy); QML is mostly anchoring
- size constraints (widthForHeight() etc.)

---

QSkinny is also free software (LGPLv2)

---

Thanks!
