# [fit] QSkinny - A new approach
# [fit] for a QtQuick framework

# [fit] Why
# [fit] QSkinny?

# Why create QSkinny?

[remove - QtWidgets: only software rendering
- QtQuickControls 1: performance issues
- QtQuickControls 2: only extensible from QML]
- ### performance: TQC: replacing QML with C++ in controls (QQC1 -> QQC2); same solution is true for application code; let programmer decide what to write in QML and what in C++
- C++: no bridging to QML needed
- C++ tooling, debugging etc.
- C++: personal preference
- performance (startup, memory, property binding changes (deferred updates etc.)?

^ ... as in: Why was it created?
^ Qt 5.3: V4 not fast enough
^ team background: QtWidgets and C++; QML was new
^ QtQuickControls 1: performance issues (all in QML, now deprecated)
^ QQC2: solution was to use C++ => too much QML can easily be a problem for performance.
^ QtQuickControls 2: not extensible (font, palette, locale / some of its logic is in QML)
^ => try how far you can get with own framework

---

# Why use QSkinny?

- public C++ API
- usable from QML
- runs with Qt 5.6 (LGPLv2)
- [free software (LGPLv2; MIT/BSD in the future?)]

^ QSkinny and QML are not mutually exclusive, programmer can decide how much of each he/she wants (including no QML)
^ mix and match C++/QML
^ LGPLv2: works with Qt 5.6; not much new on the C++ side (except Vulkan / shapes)

# [fit] What
# [fit] is QSkinny?

---

### A lightweight framework on top of the Qt scene graph

![inline](QSkinny.png)

^ maybe 2 diagrams? Qsk / QML and QSkinny / QtWidgets
^ Qsk / SG: synchronisation points, QtWidgets doesn't have those

---

# API example

```c++
    QskWindow window;
    auto box = new QskLinearBox(Qt::Vertical);
    auto button = new QskPushButton("push me", box);
    auto label = new QskTextLabel("label", box);
    window.addItem(box);
    window.show();
```

^ QSkinny does not only offer a C++ API, it also offers:
^ a more complete layouting system similar to the one of QtWidgets (QSizePolicy); QML is mostly anchoring
^ size constraints (widthForHeight() etc.)
^ ### create box later, call addItem() 2x to demonstrate

---

# separation of implementation and styling

```
setMetric( QskSlider::Panel | QskAspect::Size, 20 );
setColor( QskPushButton::Text, QColor( Qt::green ) );
setAnimation( SoundControl::SliderControl | QskAspect::Color, duration );
```

^ ### AGCO: more flexibility wrt. styling, not only colours and metrics, but also handles etc. example checkbox: Haken vs. switch; hard to do in QML
^ ### controls werden durch delegates gezeichnet; delegates kÃ¶nnen ausgetauscht werden -> Diagramm
^ theming: 2 Stufen: 1. metrics / colors / animations, 2. Skinlets (delegates)

---

# [fit] How
# [fit] does QSkinny work?

---

# example: QskPageIndicator

// TODO: here picture of page indicator

```
QSGNode* QskPageIndicatorSkinlet::updateBulletsNode(
    const QskPageIndicator* indicator, QSGNode* node ) const
{
    for ( int i = 0; i < indicator->count(); i++ )
    {
        bulletNode = new QskBoxNode();
        (...)
    }
}
```

^ QskPageIndicator: one QObjects, one scene graph node per bullet; derives from QQuickItem; method above is called from updatePaintNode

^ ###: eher: Vgl. Anzahl QQuickItems und Szenengraphenknoten etc.
^ Vgl nicht ganz fair

---

# QtQuickControls2 PageIndicator

```
T.PageIndicator {
    (...)
    delegate: Rectangle {
        (...)
    }
}
```

^ each bullet is one QQuickItem (fine for page indicator, but think e.g. gradient stop)
